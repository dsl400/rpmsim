Task: Integrate hardware mocks with main_sim.py

Description:
Connect the hardware mocks to the simulation environment in main_sim.py.

Steps to complete:
1. Open main_sim.py
2. Import the necessary classes from sim/hardware/hardware.py
3. Instantiate the hardware mock objects (WifiMock, FileSystemMock, etc.)
4. Integrate these objects with the rest of the simulation code

User acceptance criteria:
- main_sim.py should import and instantiate the hardware mocks
- The simulation environment should be able to use these mocks for hardware interactions
