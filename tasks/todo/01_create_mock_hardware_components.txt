Task: Create mock for other hardware components

Description:
Implement mocks for any additional hardware components needed in the simulation.

Steps to complete:
1. Open hardware.py in the sim/hardware directory
2. Identify any other hardware components that need to be simulated (e.g., sensors, buttons)
3. Create appropriate mock classes with basic functionality
4. Implement necessary methods and attributes for each component

User acceptance criteria:
- hardware.py should contain mock classes for additional hardware components as needed
- Each class should have at least one method that simulates the component's functionality
